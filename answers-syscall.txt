> Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
usertrap

> What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
0x7
the syscall number of SYS_exec

> What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
user mode

> Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
lw	a3,0(zero)
a3

> Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
Because the kernel is trying to access the address 0, which is not mapped in the kernel address space.
Yes, the scause value is 0xd, which means load page fault.

> What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
initcode
