> Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0-a7. a2.

> Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
0x26 stores the call to function f and g. The compiler inlines f and g.

> At what address is the function printf located?
0x630

> What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x38

> What is the output?
He110 World. 0x726c6400. We don't need to change 57616.

> In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
The top 4 bytes above the address of x in stack. Because it puts a1-a7 to stack, after reading x from a1, it will try read y from a2 which is the next 4 bytes of x.
